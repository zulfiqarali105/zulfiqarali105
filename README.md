- 👋 Hi, I’m @zulfiqarali105
I'm 48years old and have just recently ignited my childhood passion of coding.
I started with programming the commodore vic 20 when I was about 7years old.
progressed to coding on the BBC Micro and became the junior school IT controllor, looking after the school BBC micro .
After sixth form I should have continued with computer science but ended up doing chemistry at university and then got married had children.
My life changed drastically and after making some life altering decisions for the next 20 years spent working in the food industry.
For the last 9 years i have suffered with crippiling depression, anxiety and hallucinations.
I am pretty much stable on medication and have recently renewed my love of coding by accident !!
